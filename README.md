# Py City Schools Analysis

## Math Gap

The analysis performed on Py City Schools immediately demonstrates a significant gap in standardized test scores between math and reading. A summary of the overall district shows a notable gap between the percentage of student passing the math section(s) and the percentage of students passing the reading sections(s). 
### District Summary

The gap between math and reading proficiencies grows significantly when evaluating the lowest five performing schools. Py City Schools District reports overall passing math scores at 11.8% lower than reading scores. The lowest performing schools report passing math score between 13.8% and 15.1% lower than those achieved in reading.

### Bottom Performing Schools by Overall Passing Percentage

The top performing schools have a much smaller discrepancy between passing math scores and passing reading scores, reporting differences as small as 3%.

This may indicate the allocating more resources or improved resources to math curriculums, especially in underperforming schools may increase the school’s overall performance. The five bottom performing schools were all district type schools and the top five performing schools were all charter type schools. While all schools experience a gap in passing scores between math and reading that gap is much more significant in district schools over charter schools. 


## Charter Schools .vs District Schools 

Charter schools outperform district schools in both reading and math scores. This is evident in both student averages and passing percentages. It may be that the type of school has an impact on the school’s performance. 

### Scores by School Type

Type of school might only be one factor that results in charter schools performing better. To get a better picture we also looked at per student school budgets as a factor of performance. Below we have selected two schools with similar per student budgets and very different success rates. Based on the data from these two schools it is safe to conclude that budget alone is not a determining factor in school success rates.

When we evaluate all schools per student spending it fortifies the conclusion that school funding is not a direct driver of school performance. It appears to demonstrate that the more per student spending lowers the overall performance. There are other factors that may have created this result, for instance there may have been additional spending allocated to schools that were underperforming in the past. Past budget information was not made available at the time of this analysis.

Class size may also have an impact on school performance. Small and medium class sizes performed similarly, however larger schools (those with over 2000 students for our analysis) performed poorly. 

### Scores by School Size

Charter schools did tend to be smaller than district schools, the smallest of the charter schools with 427 students and the largest with 2283 performed similarly with the larger of the two outperforming the smaller school. While it seems clear that charter schools outperform district schools in standardized test results, there may be other factors outside the statistical information that influences these results. Broadly these factors may include demographic factors and individual educational priorities of students and families.


## Conclusion
Math is tough.
Charter Schools Rock!
